## Introduction

Descriptive statistics are essential for understanding the basic properties of a dataset. This repository compiles R codes for various descriptive statistical analyses, including measures of central tendency, dispersion, visualization techniques, and more. Whether you're a beginner learning R or an experienced statistician seeking reference material, this repository aims to be a valuable resource.

## Usage

Explore the folders in this repository to find R scripts for different types of descriptive statistical analyses. Each script is accompanied by comments and explanations to make it easy to understand and apply to your own datasets.

```R
# Example R Code
# Calculate mean and standard deviation
data <- c(10, 15, 20, 25, 30)
mean_value <- mean(data)
sd_value <- sd(data)

print(paste("Mean:", mean_value))
print(paste("Standard Deviation:", sd_value))
```

Feel free to adapt, modify, and use the provided code snippets in your own R projects.
